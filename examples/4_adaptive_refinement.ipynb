    "The project plan includes an `AdaptiveGrid` class for true adaptive refinement (i.e., subdividing only specific boxes). However, this class is not yet implemented in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we will use `UniformGrid` with the `iterative_morse_computation` function. The function's `adaptive` flag will not have a practical effect; instead, the `UniformGrid` will refine itself uniformly at each step. This still effectively showcases the iterative workflow of starting coarse and progressively adding detail."
